# Progress Trackr

Find the app here: https://task-analysis.firebaseapp.com/

Progress Trackr is a tool built to allow teachers (in any sense of that word - they can be parents or direct support workers or behavior analysts, etc.) to create, edit, and make notes to track a Task Analysis.  This was inspired by my previous career working with adults with Autism.  We typically had to keep all notes on paper which led to legibility issues and a generally low quality of tracking.  Progress Trackr aims to address these issues.

## Technology Used
* Firebase
* Firestore
* React

## Intended User Flow
1. A user registers with an account
2. The user creates a student
3. The user creates a task
4. The user assigns a particular task to a particular student
5. The user writes notes to track the progress of the student.

## Future improvements 
* I would like to improve the UI of the program and the aesthetics to make it more pleasing to use
* I would like to give users the ability to assign other users to students so that multiple teachers can track and take notes on the same student
