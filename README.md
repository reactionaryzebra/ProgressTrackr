# Progress Trackr

Progress Trackr is a tool built to allow teachers (in any sense of that word - they can be parents or direct support workers or behavior analysts, etc.) to create, edit, and make notes to track a Task Analysis.  This was inspired by my previous career working with adults with Autism.  We typically had to keep all notes on paper which led to legibility issues and a generally low quality of tracking.  Progress Trackr aims to address these issues.
